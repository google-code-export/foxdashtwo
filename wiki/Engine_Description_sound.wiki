#summary How the sound/audio/music engine works

==Speaker Description==

Typical speakers on mobile platforms are stereo, low power, and low quality. Headphones can provide clearer sound, but it would be safe to assume most people don't utilize external speakers while on their mobile device.

==File Format==

Fox Dash Two uses OGG format for all sounds and music. OGG is open source and allows for high quality (lossy, lossless, or uncompressed) variable length audio while keeping a relatively small file size. Recommended bitrate is 128Kbps, but anything in the range of 80-320Kbps is acceptable.

==Interaction==

There are two main ways of presenting audio in Fox Dash Two

===Sounds===

 * 15 seconds or less in length
 * Many of the same sound, or different sounds can be played at the same time
 * Limited effects, only mono volume control
 * no playlist or similar support

===Music===

 * Any length 
 * Only one music track plays at any moment
 * Fade in, Fade out (no crossfade), independent left-right volume control, seek, pause
 * Playlists can be setup, as well as looping single or groups of tracks

==Final Notes==

It should be noted that sounds and music can both be played at the same time.
