#summary Graphical aspects of the game engine

==Screen Size==
Typical 'screen area' is 800x480 for phones, while tablets are 1280x800. The engine automatically accounts for screen size and adjusts things to fit.

==File Format==
The game is made out of 2D sprite sheets, with support for transparency. Meaning supported formats are jpg, and png.

==Interaction==
The main character's interaction surfaces are axis aligned bounding boxes. In short, the protagonist walks on flat floors and hits flat walls. Slopes, hills, angles, are currently not possible.

==Layers==
There are 10 layers of sprites. 0-4 are foreground layers (objects are in front of main character). 5 is the main character and interaction layer, 6-10 are background layers (main character is in front of objects). Different layers can slide/move at different rates as well to simulate distance.

==Animation==
Animation is accomplished by multiple frames on a sprite sheet. Any frames per second can be specified (eg .5fps, 200fps, etc) as well as any position/ordering of frames. Multiple animations can be stored in a single sprite sheet.

==Cut Scenes==
Handled by moving the animations along a vector in engine, making things easy and there no need for rendering outside of the game.
