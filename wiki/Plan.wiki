#summary The Plan for Fox Dash 2.

= Introduction =
Below should summarize the plan of attack for Fox Dash 2. Including important dates, goals, and any other details.

= Description =
Fox Dash 2 is much like Fox Dash which is much like Canabalt. A continuous running game where the player must jump to avoid hitting obstacles and thus starting over.

== Mechanics ==
The screen will scroll from ~left to right~ right to left depending on the orientation of the device. The fox will run continuously and jump when a finger touches the screen.

== Bad Guys ==
  * Black smoke (give it a name?)
  * Bad pickups that slow you down
  * Pits/jumps
== Good Guys ==
Level ups
  * stars much like the first game
  * additional pickups that make you go faster

== Assets ==
Helpful list of assets used in the game.

== Engine ==
The Engine will be broken down into X number of Parts.

*Setup/Activity*
  * Handles loading of the game from cold boot
  * Closing the game
  * Minimizing the game, including saving states
  * Reopening the game (warm boot)
  * Setting/preparing/handling pause states (incoming call for example)

  * This will also be the entrypoint for onUpdate and onDraw

*Input*
  * Manages button presses
  * Including volume/home/etc keys

*Loader*
  * Loads in all assets
  * Stores all assets properly
  * Destroys assets appropriately

*Sprites/Graphics*
  * Holds graphical asset properties (width/length/position)
  * Handles animation
  * Draws the graphic

*Text/Font*
  * Draws texts to the screen.
  * Allows text to be a button(click)

*Sound/Music*
  * Holds audio properties (length/speed/volume)
  * Contains state (playing/paused/etc)

*Math/Helper*
  * Contains useful methods (linear interpolate)
  * Stores static variables (screen orientation/DPI)

*Physics*
  * May be a part of Math or Graphics, depending on how the engine develops

*File IO*
  * Mostly handled by Simple XML.
  * Small Wrapper needed

*Networking(optional?)*
  * Manages connection to network/servers
  * Handles sending and receiving of data

*AD Manager*
  * JUST KIDDING
  * Fox Dash will NEVER have ads! :)

== Code Practices == 
Variables will be all lower-case words separated by underscores.
{{{
int my_int;
}}}
Methods should have a declaration comment, first word lower-case, all other words camel-case
{{{
/****
My Method!
*****/
void onUpdate();
}}}
Everything else is fairgame. Files /should/ be all camel-case.
{{{
MyFile.png
}}}
  * It is a wacky system, but it is better than nothing.
