#summary How to use FD2 engine.

=I want to make a game!=
===And don't know what engine to go with?===

Fox Dash Two features:
 * Easy to use and setup
 * Open Source under an easy to use license
 * OpenGL ES 2.0
 * No messing with low level code or shaders
 * Simple Physics, lights, particles, and other features built in
 * Textured quads, animated quads, generated compressed quads, and more

===Drawing numbers to the screen===

 # Go to the screen file 
 # add the following lines of code in the method onDrawConstant
{{{
//convert screen coords to shader coords
double x_pos = Functions.screenXToShaderX(200);
double y_pos = Functions.screenYToShaderY(200);
		
//draw the number 198765432 at the position (200,200)
Constants.text.drawNumber(198765432, x_pos, y_pos, EnumDrawFrom.bottom_left);
